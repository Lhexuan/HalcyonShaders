**REQUIRES OPTIFINE 1.12 C7 OR GREATER!**

Halcyon will be heavily relying on the new deferred programs that have been added into Optifine, which opens up new avenues for development.

There will be some files in the root directory, that go over the specifics of the shader, as well as explains some of the more technical details that go into shader development.
