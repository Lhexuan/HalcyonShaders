**REQUIRES OPTIFINE 1.12 C7 OR GREATER!**

Halcyon shaders for Minecraft: Java Edition, using Optifine.

Halcyon will be heavily relying on the new deferred programs that have been added into Optifine, which opens up new avenues for development.

There will be some files in the root directory, that go over the specifics of the shader, as well as explains some of the more technical details that go into shader development.

# Installation
1. Find the `Clone or Download` button on this page, click it, then select `Download ZIP`.

5. If you don't have any archive programs installed, double click the ZIP to open it.
6. With the ZIP open, you should see a folder called `HalcyonShaders-master`. Right click this folder, and click `Copy`.
7. Go back to the `shaderpacks` folder, right click on any blank section, and click `Paste`.
8. Now that the shader is in the `shaderpacks` folder, delete the ZIP.
