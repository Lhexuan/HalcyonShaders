Halcyon shaders for Minecraft; Java Edition, using Optifine.

This is an upcoming pack that will be using the new forward programs that will soon be added to Optifine, and due to the sheer magnitude of changes that will take place to fully support the new forward programs, I think it's best to just start a new pack.
